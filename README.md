# My personal website to showcase my frontend skills. Soon to be expanded to include my entire portfolio, with numerous pages and interactive examples.


## Milestone 1 Feedback

I'll start off by saying - nice job with the styling. While it wasn't required, I'm glad you put some extra time into it and made it interesting to look at. Just thought I'd mention

Your Purpose is done very well, especially where you stated that it would eventually turn into a portfolio. I would say that's out of scope during the class (not to mention you may not have a whole lot of work to add to that portfolio at the moment) but it's a great idea to have a plan for the future, and I think a portfolio of your accomplishments and projects as a web developer is a good thing to have. Nice job there.

Your Audience and Goal is also done very well, no edits needed there. You've chosen your targetted viewers, and they're good decisions.

Persona - Facebook huh? Ambitious. Your Persona mentions a problem that I'm sure many employers face - the boring stack of resumes that they're forced to choose from. Make sure (and I don't think this will be an issue for you) that your site is exciting and eye catching in order for Mark to pay more attention to you and your skills. 


Your Use Case explains the process of finding you very well. I also like how you mention he has to confirm he's not a robot, because your contact form will be using ReCaptcha. Great job explaining the process.

Your directory structure and HTML is perfect, even with all the additions you did. Fantastic job.


### Edits &amp; Suggestions

You mentioned that Mark uses a Macbook, but does he not have a phone? Make sure to mention what mobile device he's using, as you will have to make your site mobile responsive, and he may be on the move when he finds your site. Also, I feel like a dude that owns a Pagani may also have a cell phone. Maybe.

What is Mark's favorite search engine? Is it IE? Because that's gonna be annoying for development. Is it Oprah? Mention that as well. It tells us that you plan to test on as many browsers as possible with your site.

#### Fantastic job on Milestone 1. You've passed in Tier IV. Keep up the good work!



## Milestone 2 Feedback

Great job on directory structure, as well as your HTML and your indentation. No issues there.

I like the structure of your site when described in the content strategy, but I feel like it may be out of order. I would suggest STARTING with a Call to Action instead of including it in the third section of the site. It will grab the users attention more than random testimonials would. Think about what you would want the CTA to link to (consider using anchors for these so the user can scroll directly to that section of the page.) You could then just include a contact form at the bottom of the page, which is a requirement of the project.

Your wireframe layout, while simple, seems to be missing something. I know that you're capable of creating an interesting site, and I'd like to see more on the final site than just an about me section and testimonials. Add content, style it in an interesting, unique, eye-catching way. Prior to our in-class coverage on the Bootstrap framework, have a look at the Official Bootstrap Documentation and the Deep Dive Bootstrap Material. See if this gives you any inspiration for columns of content.

I would suggest featuring some form of showcase for previous projects you've worked on. Obviously during the class, it may be sort of empty. As you continue as a developer, you can add to it so clients can see what you're capable of. I may leave out a link to just-the.tips, but that's all up to you. You may want to consider using an image slider for this. The Bootstrap framework does have an image slider included, but it's not that great. If this is a feature you're interested in having on the site, take a look at the Flickity Slider, the Owl Carosel or Slick. These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly.

You may also want to consider adding social media icons to your site so clients can find you elsewhere. For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward. http://fontawesome.io/



### Overall, you've done a great job, I just feel like you can do more with this project. Think of ways to make your site more interesting. Then again, maybe I'm wrong and just not seeing the possibilities with what you've presented. Either way, you've passed Milestone 2a in Tier IV. Good job.
