# My personal website to showcase my frontend skills. Soon to be expanded to include my entire portfolio, with numerous pages and interactive examples.


## Milestone 1 Feedback

I'll start off by saying - nice job with the styling. While it wasn't required, I'm glad you put some extra time into it and made it interesting to look at. Just thought I'd mention

Your Purpose is done very well, especially where you stated that it would eventually turn into a portfolio. I would say that's out of scope during the class (not to mention you may not have a whole lot of work to add to that portfolio at the moment) but it's a great idea to have a plan for the future, and I think a portfolio of your accomplishments and projects as a web developer is a good thing to have. Nice job there.

Your Audience and Goal is also done very well, no edits needed there. You've chosen your targetted viewers, and they're good decisions.

Persona - Facebook huh? Ambitious. Your Persona mentions a problem that I'm sure many employers face - the boring stack of resumes that they're forced to choose from. Make sure (and I don't think this will be an issue for you) that your site is exciting and eye catching in order for Mark to pay more attention to you and your skills. 


Your Use Case explains the process of finding you very well. I also like how you mention he has to confirm he's not a robot, because your contact form will be using ReCaptcha. Great job explaining the process.

Your directory structure and HTML is perfect, even with all the additions you did. Fantastic job.


### Edits &amp; Suggestions

You mentioned that Mark uses a Macbook, but does he not have a phone? Make sure to mention what mobile device he's using, as you will have to make your site mobile responsive, and he may be on the move when he finds your site. Also, I feel like a dude that owns a Pagani may also have a cell phone. Maybe.

What is Mark's favorite search engine? Is it IE? Because that's gonna be annoying for development. Is it Oprah? Mention that as well. It tells us that you plan to test on as many browsers as possible with your site.

#### Fantastic job on Milestone 1. You've passed in Tier IV. Keep up the good work!
